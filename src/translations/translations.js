    marketplaceDetailed: 'SDeal Marketplace\n\nSDeal is an international marketplace where sellers can offer their products to consumers in seven European countries. The platform combines the reach of a major sales channel with smart marketing automation. Sellers get full control over their prices, commissions and product offerings, while SDeal handles traffic, advertising and conversion optimization.\n\nThe strength of SDeal lies in the connection between performance marketing and marketplace sales. For each product, the set commission is directly used to attract targeted traffic, particularly via Google Shopping. Competitive prices and in-demand products are therefore automatically rewarded with more visibility.\n\nSDeal also offers sellers a repricer tool and an extensive dashboard to track sales performance and optimize prices. This way, sellers can compete on both price and performance, while the platform handles marketing.\n\nWe offer three options:\n\n1. Marketplace with fixed commission\nWith a fixed commission, you benefit from automatic marketing. SDeal handles traffic, advertising and conversion optimization.\n\n2. Marketplace with self-set commission\nWith your own commission setting, you also benefit from automatic marketing. SDeal handles traffic, advertising and conversion optimization.\n\n3. CPC (CaaS)\nWith Clicks as a Service, you pay a fixed monthly amount for visibility and traffic. No automatic marketing is performed.\n\nIn short: SDeal is a marketplace that not only sells, but actively grows with the performance of its sellers, transparent, scalable and fully focused on returns.',

    dealCSSDesc: 'Up to 20% discount on Google Shopping click costs. When you bid 1 euro per click, 100% goes to the auction instead of 80%, resulting in a 25% bid increase without extra effort.',
    dealCSSDetailed: 'DEAL CSS\n\nWith DEAL CSS, SDeal offers sellers the opportunity to advertise through our own Comparison Shopping Service (CSS), a Google-recognized comparison service.\n\nInstead of advertising directly through Google Shopping, the ad display runs through DEAL CSS. This is not only fully compatible with your existing Merchant Center, but also delivers direct benefits in Google\'s ad auctions.\n\nWhat is a CSS?\n\nA CSS (Comparison Shopping Service) is an independent party that displays product ads on behalf of webshops in Google Shopping. Since European competition rules require Google to share its Shopping space with external providers, sellers can advertise more cheaply through a CSS.\n\nWhy choose DEAL CSS\n\nUp to 20% lower click prices (CPC)\nGoogle offers a structural discount on clicks purchased through an external CSS. Sellers who advertise through DEAL CSS therefore directly benefit from lower costs per click.\n\nMore visibility with the same budget\nDue to lower click prices, you can generate more traffic with the same ad budget or perform better in Google Shopping\'s auction position.\n\nWorks independently of SDeal\nDEAL CSS works with your existing Merchant Center. Your current Merchant Center setup remains exactly the same. You only benefit from Google\'s discount on clicks purchased through an external CSS.\n\nTransparent and scalable\nYou retain insight into your performance and only pay the actual click or platform costs, without hidden commissions.\n\nIn summary\n\nDEAL CSS is the smart way to advertise your products through Google Shopping, with lower click prices, higher visibility and without extra complexity.',

    packageWhyTitle: 'Why this update?',
    packageWhyText: 'SDeal started as a pure 3rd-party marketplace. We have noticed that the traditional commission model unintentionally creates disadvantages for sellers. When a higher commission is requested, margin pressure arises for the seller. This makes it more difficult to offer sharp consumer prices, and that has a direct effect on conversion, volume and competitiveness.\n\nBy switching to a hybrid marketplace + SaaS model where the commission is fully used as marketing budget and our revenue model is in the fixed package price, we prevent that margin pressure. Sellers thus retain more room to offer competitive prices, which ultimately leads to more sales and a healthier ecosystem for everyone.',

Het platform combineert het bereik van een groot verkoopkanaal met slimme marketingautomatisering. Sellers krijgen volledige controle over hun prijzen, commissies en productaanbod, terwijl SDeal zorgt voor verkeer, advertenties en conversieoptimalisatie.\n\nDe kracht van SDeal ligt in de koppeling tussen performance-marketing en marktplaatsverkoop. Voor elk product wordt de ingestelde commissie rechtstreeks gebruikt om gericht verkeer aan te trekken, met name via Google Shopping. Scherpe prijzen en gewilde producten worden daardoor automatisch beloond met meer zichtbaarheid.\n\nSDeal biedt sellers daarnaast een repricer-tool en een uitgebreid dashboard om verkoopprestaties te volgen en prijzen te optimaliseren. Op die manier kunnen sellers concurreren op basis van prijs én performance, terwijl het platform de marketing verzorgt.\n\nWe bieden drie opties:\n\n1. Marketplace met vaste commissie\nBij een vaste commissie profiteer je van automatische marketing. SDeal zorgt voor verkeer, advertenties en conversieoptimalisatie.\n\n2. Marketplace met eigen ingestelde commissie\nBij een eigen ingestelde commissie profiteer je ook van automatische marketing. SDeal zorgt voor verkeer, advertenties en conversieoptimalisatie.\n\n3. CPC (CaaS)\nBij Clicks as a Service betaal je een vast maandbedrag voor zichtbaarheid en verkeer.

Sinds de Europese mededingingsregels verplichten dat Google zijn Shopping-ruimte deelt met externe aanbieders, kunnen sellers via een CSS goedkoper adverteren.\n\nWaarom kiezen voor DEAL CSS\n\nTot 20% lagere klikprijzen (CPC)\nGoogle biedt een structurele korting aan op klikken die via een externe CSS worden gekocht. Sellers die adverteren via DEAL CSS profiteren dus direct van lagere kosten per klik.\n\nMeer zichtbaarheid met hetzelfde budget\nDoor lagere klikprijzen kun je met hetzelfde advertentiebudget meer verkeer genereren of beter presteren in de veilingpositie van Google Shopping.\n\nWerkt onafhankelijk van SDeal\nDEAL CSS werkt met je bestaande Merchant Center.

    packageWhyText: 'SDeal is gestart als een pure 3rd-party marketplace. We hebben gemerkt dat het traditionele commissiemodel onbedoeld nadelen oplevert voor sellers. Wanneer een hogere commissie wordt gevraagd, ontstaat er margedruk bij de seller. Daardoor wordt het moeilijker om scherpe consumentenprijzen aan te bieden, en dat heeft direct effect op conversie, volume en concurrentiekracht.\n\nDoor over te stappen naar een hybride marketplace + SaaS-model waarbij de commissie volledig wordt ingezet als marketingbudget en ons verdienmodel in de vaste pakketprijs zit, voorkomen we die margedruk. Sellers houden zo meer ruimte om concurrerende prijzen te bieden, wat uiteindelijk zorgt voor meer verkoop en een gezonder ecosysteem voor iedereen.',

    marketplaceDetailed: 'SDeal Marketplace\n\nSDeal ist eine internationale Marktplatz, auf der Verkäufer ihre Produkte an Verbraucher in sieben europäischen Ländern anbieten können. Die Plattform kombiniert die Reichweite eines großen Vertriebskanals mit intelligenter Marketing-Automatisierung. Verkäufer erhalten vollständige Kontrolle über ihre Preise, Provisionen und Produktangebote, während SDeal für Traffic, Werbung und Konversionsoptimierung sorgt.\n\nDie Stärke von SDeal liegt in der Verbindung zwischen Performance-Marketing und Marktplatzverkauf. Für jedes Produkt wird die festgelegte Provision direkt verwendet, um gezielten Traffic anzuziehen, insbesondere über Google Shopping. Wettbewerbsfähige Preise und gefragte Produkte werden daher automatisch mit mehr Sichtbarkeit belohnt.\n\nSDeal bietet Verkäufern außerdem ein Repricer-Tool und ein umfassendes Dashboard zur Verfolgung der Verkaufsleistung und Preisoptimierung. Auf diese Weise können Verkäufer sowohl in Bezug auf Preis als auch auf Leistung konkurrieren, während die Plattform Marketing übernimmt.\n\nWir bieten drei Optionen:\n\n1. Marktplatz mit fester Provision\nBei einer festen Provision profitieren Sie von automatischem Marketing. SDeal sorgt für Traffic, Werbung und Konversionsoptimierung.\n\n2. Marktplatz mit selbst festgelegter Provision\nBei einer selbst festgelegten Provision profitieren Sie ebenfalls von automatischem Marketing. SDeal sorgt für Traffic, Werbung und Konversionsoptimierung.\n\n3. CPC (CaaS)\nBei Clicks as a Service zahlen Sie einen festen Monatsbetrag für Sichtbarkeit und Traffic. Es wird kein automatisches Marketing durchgeführt.\n\nKurz gesagt: SDeal ist eine Marktplatz, die nicht nur verkauft, sondern aktiv mit der Leistung ihrer Verkäufer wächst, transparent, skalierbar und vollständig auf Rendite ausgerichtet.',

    dealCSSDetailed: 'DEAL CSS\n\nMit DEAL CSS bietet SDeal Verkäufern die Möglichkeit, über unseren eigenen Comparison Shopping Service (CSS) zu werben, einen von Google anerkannten Vergleichsdienst.\n\nAnstatt direkt über Google Shopping zu werben, läuft die Anzeigendarstellung über DEAL CSS. Dies ist nicht nur vollständig kompatibel mit Ihrem bestehenden Merchant Center, sondern bringt auch direkte Vorteile bei Googles Anzeigenauktionen.\n\nWas ist ein CSS?\n\nEin CSS (Comparison Shopping Service) ist eine unabhängige Partei, die im Auftrag von Webshops Produktanzeigen in Google Shopping anzeigt. Seit die europäischen Wettbewerbsregeln verlangen, dass Google seinen Shopping-Bereich mit externen Anbietern teilt, können Verkäufer über ein CSS günstiger werben.\n\nWarum DEAL CSS wählen\n\nBis zu 20% niedrigere Klickpreise (CPC)\nGoogle bietet einen strukturellen Rabatt auf Klicks, die über einen externen CSS gekauft werden. Verkäufer, die über DEAL CSS werben, profitieren daher direkt von niedrigeren Kosten pro Klick.\n\nMehr Sichtbarkeit mit dem gleichen Budget\nDurch niedrigere Klickpreise können Sie mit dem gleichen Werbebudget mehr Traffic generieren oder besser in der Auktionsposition von Google Shopping abschneiden.\n\nFunktioniert unabhängig von SDeal\nDEAL CSS funktioniert mit Ihrem bestehenden Merchant Center. Ihre aktuelle Merchant Center-Einrichtung bleibt genau gleich. Sie profitieren nur von Googles Rabatt auf Klicks, die über einen externen CSS gekauft werden.\n\nTransparent und skalierbar\nSie behalten Einblick in Ihre Leistung und zahlen nur die tatsächlichen Klick- oder Plattformkosten, ohne versteckte Provisionen.\n\nZusammenfassend\n\nDEAL CSS ist die intelligente Art, Ihre Produkte über Google Shopping zu bewerben, mit niedrigeren Klickpreisen, höherer Sichtbarkeit und ohne zusätzliche Komplexität.',

    packageWhyTitle: 'Warum dieses Update?',
    packageWhyText: 'SDeal startete als reiner 3rd-Party-Marketplace. Wir haben festgestellt, dass das traditionelle Provisionsmodell unbeabsichtigt Nachteile für Verkäufer schafft. Wenn eine höhere Provision verlangt wird, entsteht Margendruck beim Verkäufer. Dadurch wird es schwieriger, scharfe Verbraucherpreise anzubieten, und das hat direkte Auswirkungen auf Conversion, Volumen und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit.\n\nDurch den Wechsel zu einem hybriden Marketplace + SaaS-Modell, bei dem die Provision vollständig als Marketingbudget verwendet wird und unser Umsatzmodell im festen Paketpreis liegt, verhindern wir diesen Margendruck. Verkäufer behalten so mehr Spielraum, um wettbewerbsfähige Preise anzubieten, was letztendlich zu mehr Verkäufen und einem gesünderen Ökosystem für alle führt.',

    marketplaceDetailed: 'SDeal Marketplace\n\nSDeal est une place de marché internationale où les vendeurs peuvent proposer leurs produits aux consommateurs dans sept pays européens. La plateforme combine la portée d\'un grand canal de vente avec l\'automatisation marketing intelligente. Les vendeurs obtiennent un contrôle total sur leurs prix, commissions et offres de produits, tandis que SDeal gère le trafic, la publicité et l\'optimisation des conversions.\n\nLa force de SDeal réside dans le lien entre le marketing de performance et les ventes sur la place de marché. Pour chaque produit, la commission fixée est directement utilisée pour attirer un trafic ciblé, notamment via Google Shopping. Les prix compétitifs et les produits demandés sont donc automatiquement récompensés par une plus grande visibilité.\n\nSDeal offre également aux vendeurs un outil de repricing et un tableau de bord complet pour suivre les performances de vente et optimiser les prix. De cette façon, les vendeurs peuvent rivaliser sur le prix et la performance, tandis que la plateforme gère le marketing.\n\nNous offrons trois options:\n\n1. Place de marché avec commission fixe\nAvec une commission fixe, vous bénéficiez d\'un marketing automatique. SDeal gère le trafic, la publicité et l\'optimisation des conversions.\n\n2. Place de marché avec commission auto-définie\nAvec votre propre réglage de commission, vous bénéficiez également d\'un marketing automatique. SDeal gère le trafic, la publicité et l\'optimisation des conversions.\n\n3. CPC (CaaS)\nAvec Clicks as a Service, vous payez un montant mensuel fixe pour la visibilité et le trafic. Aucun marketing automatique n\'est effectué.\n\nEn bref: SDeal est une place de marché qui ne se contente pas de vendre, mais qui grandit activement avec les performances de ses vendeurs, transparente, évolutive et entièrement axée sur le rendement.',

    dealCSSDesc: 'Jusqu\'à 20% de réduction sur les coûts de clic Google Shopping. Lorsque vous enchérissez 1 euro par clic, 100% va à la vente aux enchères au lieu de 80%, ce qui entraîne une augmentation d\'enchère de 25% sans effort supplémentaire.',
    dealCSSDetailed: 'DEAL CSS\n\nAvec DEAL CSS, SDeal offre aux vendeurs la possibilité de faire de la publicité via notre propre Comparison Shopping Service (CSS), un service de comparaison reconnu par Google.\n\nAu lieu de faire de la publicité directement via Google Shopping, l\'affichage des publicités passe par DEAL CSS. Cela est non seulement entièrement compatible avec votre Merchant Center existant, mais offre également des avantages directs dans les enchères publicitaires de Google.\n\nQu\'est-ce qu\'un CSS?\n\nUn CSS (Comparison Shopping Service) est une partie indépendante qui affiche des publicités produits pour le compte de boutiques en ligne dans Google Shopping. Depuis que les règles européennes de concurrence exigent que Google partage son espace Shopping avec des fournisseurs externes, les vendeurs peuvent faire de la publicité moins cher via un CSS.\n\nPourquoi choisir DEAL CSS\n\nJusqu\'à 20% de prix de clic plus bas (CPC)\nGoogle offre une réduction structurelle sur les clics achetés via un CSS externe. Les vendeurs qui font de la publicité via DEAL CSS bénéficient donc directement de coûts par clic plus bas.\n\nPlus de visibilité avec le même budget\nGrâce à des prix de clic plus bas, vous pouvez générer plus de trafic avec le même budget publicitaire ou mieux performer dans la position d\'enchère de Google Shopping.\n\nFonctionne indépendamment de SDeal\nDEAL CSS fonctionne avec votre Merchant Center existant. La configuration actuelle de votre Merchant Center reste exactement la même. Vous ne bénéficiez que de la réduction de Google sur les clics achetés via un CSS externe.\n\nTransparent et évolutif\nVous conservez un aperçu de vos performances et ne payez que les coûts réels de clic ou de plateforme, sans commissions cachées.\n\nEn résumé\n\nDEAL CSS est le moyen intelligent de faire de la publicité pour vos produits via Google Shopping, avec des prix de clic plus bas, une visibilité accrue et sans complexité supplémentaire.',
