    <h3>Article 1 – Definitions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SDeal</strong>: SDeal B.V., located at Osloweg 110, 9723 BX Groningen.</li>
      <li><strong>User</strong>: A visitor of the Platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer</strong>: A User who places an Order with a Seller via the Platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Agreement</strong>: The purchase agreement concluded via the Platform between Customer and Seller, with SDeal acting as commercial agent on behalf of the Seller.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform</strong>: The online platform operated by SDeal, accessible via www.sdeal.nl, www.sdeal.be and/or other websites or online channels of SDeal.</li>
      <li><strong>PSP</strong>: The payment service provider appointed by SDeal to deliver technical solutions and supporting processes required for collecting payments made by Customers to Sellers.</li>
      <li><strong>Foundation</strong>: Stichting Beheer Cliëntgelden SDeal, a foundation designated by SDeal to receive payments from the PSP on behalf of Sellers.</li>
      <li><strong>Seller</strong>: A legal entity independent of SDeal, offering products or services via the Platform under an agreement with SDeal.</li>
      <li><strong>Terms</strong>: These general terms and conditions of SDeal B.V.</li>
      <li><strong>GDPR</strong>: General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679).</li>
      <li><strong>Shopping Cart Option</strong>: The feature on the Platform that enables the Customer to pay for products ordered from a Seller via the Platform and facilitates the onward payment to the Seller.</li>
      <li><strong>Order</strong>: One or more purchase requests placed via the Platform, which SDeal forwards to the Seller while also facilitating the payment process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 2 – Applicability</h3>
    <p>These Terms apply to all use of the Platform by Users, all offers on the Platform, and any (remote) purchases made by Customers from Sellers via the Platform. By placing an Order, the Customer agrees to these Terms. SDeal and any third parties engaged by SDeal, including PSPs, may rely on these Terms. The latest version of the Terms is always available on the Platform. SDeal may update these Terms unilaterally, and the revised version will apply from the moment it is published on the website. Customers must re-accept the Terms with each Order placed.</p>

    <h3>Article 3 – Role of SDeal</h3>
    <p>SDeal operates the Platform, provides the Shopping Cart Option, and facilitates the formation of Agreements. SDeal acts solely as a commercial agent for Sellers and is never a party to the Agreement. Sellers remain responsible for the products or services they offer, and Customers acknowledge that the Agreement is concluded between them and the Seller. SDeal is not liable for product information, availability, or delivery. Product details are provided by Sellers and may not always be accurate or up-to-date. The Platform may not always be available due to maintenance or other interruptions.</p>

    <h3>Article 4 – Account, Orders, and Delivery</h3>
    <p>Users can create an account on the Platform but are not required to do so to place an Order. When an account is created, Users are responsible for protecting their login credentials. Customers must meet eligibility requirements (e.g., age, valid contact details, delivery location) to place an Order. Orders are subject to Seller’s terms and conditions and are processed accordingly. Customers are responsible for providing accurate information and must accept these Terms and Seller’s terms before placing an Order. Orders will be confirmed via email, and the Seller is responsible for delivery. SDeal is not liable for delivery issues.</p>

    <h3>Article 5 – Payment via Shopping Cart Option</h3>
    <p>Customers can use the Shopping Cart Option to pay for Orders via the Platform. Payments are processed through the PSP and received by the Foundation on behalf of the Seller. Direct payments to Sellers are not accepted. If payment is late, the Seller may charge interest and fees. SDeal and its appointed parties act solely as intermediaries and are not liable for any issues arising from payments.</p>

    <h3>Article 6 – Right of Withdrawal</h3>
    <p>Customers may withdraw from the Agreement within 14 days of receiving the product unless the product or service is exempt by law. To withdraw, Customers must follow the Seller’s return process. If withdrawal is accepted, the Seller will refund the amount paid. SDeal, the Foundation, and the PSP are not responsible for refunds. Customers must return products in original condition and packaging where possible.</p>

    <h3>Article 7 – Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>All intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trademarks, and trade names) related to content, images, and text on the Platform belong to SDeal, Sellers, or their licensors. Users may not reproduce, alter, or share any content from the Platform without prior written permission.</p>

    <h3>Article 8 – Personal Data</h3>
    <p>SDeal processes personal data in accordance with its Privacy Policy. Customers agree that their data may be shared with Sellers to fulfill the Agreement. SDeal may use contact information for service and satisfaction inquiries. SDeal is not responsible for how Sellers handle personal data. For more details, refer to both SDeal’s and the Seller’s privacy policies.</p>

    <h3>Article 9 – Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>These Terms and any related legal relationships are governed exclusively by Dutch law. The Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. Any disputes shall be submitted exclusively to the competent court in the district of Gelderland, location Arnhem, the Netherlands.</p>

    <h3>Article 10 – Miscellaneous</h3>
    <p>SDeal may limit access to the Shopping Cart Option or accounts for valid reasons (e.g., abuse or legal violations). SDeal may modify the Platform at any time. If any provision is invalid, the rest remain in force, and the invalid provision shall be replaced with a lawful equivalent. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms does not constitute a waiver. Customers must comply with these Terms and applicable laws at all times. Offensive behavior may lead to restricted access.</p>
