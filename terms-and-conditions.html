    <h3>Article 2. Applicability</h3>
<p>2.1 These Terms apply to the use of the Platform by the User, all offers made on the Platform, as well as to all (remote) orders and purchases made by the Customer from the Seller via the Platform, whether or not the Shopping Cart Option is used.</p>
<p>2.2 Not only SDeal, but also third parties engaged by SDeal, including PSPs, may invoke these Terms.</p>
<p>2.3 By placing an Order, the Customer accepts the applicability of these Terms. The text of these Terms is available at all times on the Platform and will also be made available to the Customer, either electronically or otherwise, prior to the conclusion of an Agreement. The Customer may download and save the Terms.</p>
<p>2.4 SDeal reserves the right to unilaterally supplement, modify, or replace these Terms. The amended Terms shall apply as soon as they are published on the website(s). The Customer must accept the Terms again with each new Order. By placing a subsequent Order for a product offered via the Platform, the Customer accepts the amended Terms. Therefore, it is advisable to review the Terms before placing an Order through the Platform.</p>

    <h3>Article 3. Role of SDeal</h3>
<p>3.1 SDeal operates the Platform, provides the Shopping Cart Option, and facilitates the conclusion of Agreements between Customers and Sellers. SDeal acts solely as a commercial agent on behalf of the Seller in the conclusion of these Agreements and is never a party to the Agreement itself.</p>

<p>10.4 The failure of SDeal to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be considered a waiver of the right to enforce that provision or any other provision.</p>
